# Project Description


Tech meetups & workshops for coders, CTO's, startups & techies. Learn from one another and collaborate over the usual free pizza & beer.


## Deliverables

Ongoing meetups & workshops in our own venue (Sofia Bulgaria), then we plan to use https://bucharest.techhub.com/ (Bucharest) or  CITY College (Thessaloniki, Greece)
Questions are approached technically from a computer science point of view, mathematically, or economically.
Economics plays a big role and we invite economic experts to participate and speak.
We also invite the most interesting companies within these fields to gather relevant experts and facilitate debates.

## Development Roadmap

- Tickets: $0. We don't plan to sell tickets for this community events.
- Confirmed Venue (we confirm our venue in Sofia, it's owned by us)
- Each meetup is recorded & photographed. if anyone doesn't want to appear in photos they can put a yellow sticker on their clothes.
- We can handle 20-30 people easily
- Funding: we will try to get the venues for free (the one in Sofia is free as it's ours)
- Quality Pizza (not Dominos!) & quality beer will likely cost ~50-100 USD per event depending on how many people decide to participate
- We can also make t-shirts with filecoin logo. A quality t-shirt with a printed logo is around $10, we can also get super-quality t-shirts with $15. for 20 participants that's $200 in budget.
- $ for marketing the event until places are filled
- we do it in a not for profit way, all the funds that remain will go into the next meetup budget.
